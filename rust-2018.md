# Rust 2018

To begin, let's be clear: I like Rust. It's a very useful tool, despite the following complaints, and the only one i use for serious systems programming any more.

That said, it could be better.

## The Standard Library

The standard library has a major flaw: it aborts on failure to allocate memory. This is unacceptable in many of my use cases [1]. If it is acceptable, i am using Haskell, and trust me: you **really** want to not be competing with Haskell (and its ilk).

It would not be so bad, except for all the magic in libstd: to write an alternative means various dark rituals and incantations like `feature` and `lang` and such which are unstable and only work on nightly. `lang` in particular makes interop with crates using `std` quite difficult — if you define your own `Box`, you can't even link it in the same program as libstd, even if they are never in scope together!

Even absent lang items, it causes pain: see for example [`Vec`](https://docs.rs/containers/0.7.1/containers/collections/vec/struct.Vec.html) in my [containers crate](https://crates.io/crates/containers), which is essentially exactly the same as a `std::Vec` — pointer, length, capacity — but is a separate uninteroperable type.

## Richer-Kinded Quantification

In Haskell we can define some very useful typeclasses [2][3]:

```haskell
class Mappable f where
    map :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b

class Mappable f => Bindable f where
    bind :: (a -> f b) -> f a -> f b
    bind f = join . map f
```

Let's consider what these might be in pseudo-Rust:

```rust
trait Mappable {
    fn map<A, F: Fn(A) -> B>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B>;
}

trait Bindable: Mappable {
    fn bind<A, B, F: Fn(A) -> Self<B>>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B>;
}
```

Now let's consider some `impl`s:

```rust
impl Mappable for Option {
    fn map<A, F: Fn(A) -> B>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B> { ... }
}

impl<E> Mappable for Result<_, E> {
    fn map<A, F: Fn(A) -> B>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B> { ... }
}

impl Bindable for Option {
    fn bind<A, F: Fn(A) -> Self<B>>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B> { ... }
}

impl<E> Bindable for Result<_, E> {
    fn bind<A, F: Fn(A) -> Self<B>>(self<A>, f: F) -> Self<B> { ... }
}
```

Oh wait, we already have these methods! (`bind` is called `and_then`.) But they're not a trait method, so we can't quantify over them, alas.

---

Say we want to define a recursive data type:

```rust
enum List<A> { Nil, Cons(A, List<A>) }
```

What happens:

<span style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color:red;">error[E0072]</span>: recursive type `List` has infinite size</span>

Oops, we need an indirection! Well, say we're not sure what kind of pointer we want — in some situations we want an owned pointer to a dynamically-allocated value, in others we want an atomic (e.g. for a lock-free list), whatever. This would be another use case of higher-kinded quantification, again in pseudo-Rust:

```rust
enum List<A, Ptr> { Nil, Cons(A, Ptr<List<A>>) }
```

---

Last, i wish to note the utility of data kinds (a.k.a. const generics). Look at the [linea crate](https://docs.rs/linea/0.8.0/linea/struct.Matrix.html): we must write such hellish type signatures merely to parametrize our code over the length of an array. However, it seems const generics are [in the works](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44580), so i shall say no more here.

## *Footnotes*

[1] To the naysayers: I am not interested in arguing about this. I know my requirements and you don't. I regret to be so defensive here but it seems any claim of needing to deal gracefully with allocational failure provokes in the Rust community an onslaught of responses 'splaining why you don't **really** need to do so cuz we obviously know your situation better than you do.

[2] A typeclass is roughly analogous to a trait.

[3] These in the base library are actually called `Functor` and `Monad` [4], which is mathematical jargon irrelevant to this document. (They also have an intermediate class `Applicative` which is useful in its own right, but not significant to this document.)

[4] Yes, you in the front in the Haskell shirt, `Monad` does have another method. I omit it here for simplicity.
